> The best way to contact me is by email at **rohit \[dot\] farmer \[at\] dataalltheway \[dot\] com**

This is a not-for-profit website without advertisements and a paywall, and I intend to support it fully in the foreseeable future. However, a little support does help to cover some overhead costs of the domain name, professional email address, books (online courses), paying for graphics, and of course, coffee (the fuel).

Besides financial support, I appreciate your time and expertise in providing constructive criticism of the content on this website, suggesting corrections, contributing an article, or writing a comment for a post.

To support this website financially, please utilize one of the methods mentioned below.
