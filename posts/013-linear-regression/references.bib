               resistance and poor glycemic control. We sought to investigate
               the association between food groups and indices of glycemic
               control in adults without type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular
               disease. METHODS: During 2001 - 2002 we randomly enrolled 1514
               men (18-87 years old) and 1528 women (18-89 years old) without
               evidence of cardiovascular disease from the Attica area of
               Greece. Of them, 118 men and 92 women were excluded from the
               present analysis due to a history of diabetes mellitus (type 2).
               Fasting blood glucose and insulin levels were measured, while
               dietary habits were evaluated through a semi-quantitative food
               frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Red meat consumption was
               positively associated with hyperglycemia (p = 0.04),
               hyperinsulinemia (p = 0.04), and HOMA levels (p = 0.03), even
               after adjusting for BMI and various other potential confounders.
               The intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, yogurt and other
               dairy products was not associated with levels of glycemic
               control indices. CONCLUSIONS: A higher consumption of red meat
               and its products may aggravate hyperinsulinemia and insulin
               resistance in non-diabetic people.",

  abstract  = "Abstract Yield strength of steel is an important property in
               designing a steel component. The maximum load that material can
               sustain without undergoing permanent deformation is represented
               by yield strength. A robust model is purposed, which can
               accurately predict the yield strength of different steel grades,
               based on the varying chemical composition of steel from the
               employed database. The dataset consisting of chemical
               composition and experimental yield strength of steel rods from a
               collapsed building sites. MATLAB\textregistered{} was used to
               generate a regression model such as multivariate regression and
               linear regression, to predict the yield strength values for
               different steel grades. A comparative study among the different
               regression models for RMS error, Max error, and highest accuracy
               is discussed in this paper. [copyright information to be updated
