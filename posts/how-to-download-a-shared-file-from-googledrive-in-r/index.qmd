# Introduction

To download a shared file with "anyone with the link" access rights from Google Drive in R, we can utilize the `googledrive` library from the `tidyverse` package. The method described here will utilize the file ID copied from the shared link. Typically `googledrive` package is used to work with a Google Drive of an authenticated user. However, since we are downloading a publicly shared file in this tutorial, we will work without user authentication. So, please follow the steps below.

## Step 1: Copy the file ID from the share link.

Below is a share link from my Google Drive pointing to an R data frame.

`https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vj607etanUVYzVFj_HXkznHTd0Ltv_Y4/view?usp=sharing`

This string `1vj607etanUVYzVFj_HXkznHTd0Ltv_Y4` is the file ID that we will use to download.

## Step 2: Download the file using an authenticated connection.

```{R eval=FALSE}
if(!require(googledrive)) install.packages("googledrive")
library(googledrive)

drive_deauth()
drive_user()
public_file <-  drive_get(as_id("1vj607etanUVYzVFj_HXkznHTd0Ltv_Y4"))
drive_download(public_file, overwrite = TRUE)
```

The downloaded data frame.

```{R}
library(DT)
datatable(readRDS("hdstim-example-data.rds"))
```
