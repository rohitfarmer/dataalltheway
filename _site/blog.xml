<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>A hypothesis test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is enough evidence to support a hypothesis. For example, there is a difference between the average height of males and females. Non-parametric hypothesis tests are tests that do not rely on the assumptions of normality or equal variance. They are traditional alternatives to <a href="https://dataalltheway.com/posts/010-parametric-hypothesis-tests-r/">parametric tests</a> because they make few or no assumptions about the distribution of the data or population. Non-parametric tests are often based on ranks given to the original numerical data. Usually non-parametric tests are regarded as relatively easy to perform but some problems can occur. It can be cumbersome to carry out such tests when working with large amounts of data. In many field of study such as psychology, the data have quite restricted ranges of scores, which can result in the same value appearing several times in a set of data. Tests based on rank can become more complicated with increased tied scores. Though, non-parametric tests have fewer assumptions they are not as powerful as parametric tests.</p>
<p>The different types of non-parametric hypothesis tests are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney U test) (Section&nbsp;2),</li>
<li>the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (Section&nbsp;3), and</li>
<li>the Kruskal-Wallis test (Section&nbsp;4).</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>Besides deciding which hypothesis test to use to answer the question at hand, we also need to decide a couple of other parameters, for example, whether the test would be one sample or two samples, paired or un-paired, and one or two-tailed. I have discussed those parameters in detail <a href="https://dataalltheway.com/posts/010-parametric-hypothesis-tests-r/">here</a>.</p>
<section id="dataset" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dataset">Dataset</h2>
<p>For our example exercises, we will work with the “Global CO2 emissions from cement production” dataset <span class="citation" data-cites="andrew2022">(Andrew 2022)</span>. I have subsetted the data from 1928 onward and dropped any columns with all NAs or zeros. The table below shows all the data we will use in this tutorial.</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;1 shows per country yearly (x-axis) emissions logged to base 10 (y-axis). The log is taken for visualization purposes. All the statistical calculations will be done on the original values.</p>

<p>The emissions from the use of fossil fuels in cement production are not included in this dataset since they are usually included elsewhere in global datasets of fossil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The process emissions in this dataset, which result from the decomposition of carbonates in the production of cement clinker, amounted to ~1.7 Gt CO<sub>2</sub> in 2021, while emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels to produce the heat required amounted to an additional ~1.0 Gt CO<sub>2</sub> in 2021.</p>

<h1>Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney U test)</h1>
<p>The Wilcoxon rank-sum or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test">Mann-Whitney U</a> test is perhaps the most common non-parametric test for unrelated samples. You would use it when the two groups are independent of each other, for example in our dataset testing differences in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions between two different countries (e.g.&nbsp;USA vs.&nbsp;Canada). It can be used even when the two groups are of different sizes.</p>
<section id="the-method" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-method">The method</h2>
<ul>
<li>First, we rank all of the values (from both groups) from the smallest to largest. Equal values are allocated the average of the ranks they would have if there was tiny differences between them.</li>
<li>Next we sum the ranks for each group. You call the sum of the ranks for the larger group <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_1"> and for the smaller sized group, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_2">. If both groups are equally sized then we can label them whichever way round we like.</li>
<li>We then input <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_2"> and also <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N_2">, the respective sizes of each group, into the Equation&nbsp;1.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="eq-u-test"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbegin%7Bequation%7D%20U%20=%20(N_1%20%5Ctimes%20N_2)%20+%20%5Cdfrac%7BN_1%20%5Ctimes%20(N_1+1)%7D%7B2%7D%20-%20R_1%20%5Cend%7Bequation%7D%0A%5Ctag%7B1%7D"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Then we compare the value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?U"> to significance tables. You find the intersection of the column with the value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N_1"> and the row with the value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N_2">. In this intersection there will be two ranges of values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?U"> which are significant at the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?5%5C%25"> level. If our value is within one of these ranges, then we have a significant result and we reject the null hypothesis. If our value is not in the range then it is not significant and then the independent variable is unrelated to the dependent variable, we accept the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_0">.</li>
<li>As a check, we also need to examine the means of the two groups, to see which has the higher scores on the dependent variable.</li>

<h1>Wilcoxon signed-rank test</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test#:~:text=The%20Wilcoxon%20signed%2Drank%20test,%2Dsample%20Student's%20t%2Dtest.">Wilcoxon signed ranks test</a> also known as the Wilcoxon matched pairs test, is similar to the sign test. The only alteration is that we rank the differences ignoring their signs (but we do keep a note of them). As the name implies, we use the Wilcoxon matched pairs test on related data, so each sample or group will be equal in size.</p>
<section id="the-method-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-method-1">The method</h2>
<ul>
<li>Calculate the difference values between your two samples of data. We then remove difference values of zero.</li>
<li>Rank them. If values are tied then you use the same method as in the Mann-Whitney tests. You assign the difference scores the average rank if it was possible to separate the tied difference scores.</li>
<li>The ranks of the differences can now have the sign of the difference reattached.</li>
<li>The sum of the positive ranks are calculated.</li>
<li>The sum of the negative ranks are calculated.</li>
<li>You then choose the smaller sum of ranks and we call this our <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T"> value, which we compare with significance tables. You choose the row which has the number of pairs of values in your sample.</li>
<li>Report your findings and make your conclusion.</li>

<h1>Kruskal-Wallis test</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%E2%80%93Wallis_one-way_analysis_of_variance">Kruskal-Wallis test</a> by rank (Kruskal–Wallis H test) is a non-parametric alternative to one-way ANOVA test, which extends the two-samples Wilcoxon test in the situation where there are more than two groups. It’s recommended when the assumptions of one-way ANOVA test are not met.</p>
<p>A significant Kruskal–Wallis test indicates that at least one sample stochastically dominates one other sample. The test does not identify where this stochastic dominance occurs or for how many pairs of groups stochastic dominance obtains.</p>
<p>Since it is a nonparametric method, the Kruskal–Wallis test does not assume a normal distribution of the residuals, unlike the analogous one-way analysis of variance. If the researcher can make the assumptions of an identically shaped and scaled distribution for all groups, except for any difference in medians, then the null hypothesis is that the medians of all groups are equal, and the alternative hypothesis is that at least one population median of one group is different from the population median of at least one other group. Otherwise, it is impossible to say, whether the rejection of the null hypothesis comes from the shift in locations or group dispersions.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>A hypothesis test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is enough evidence to support a hypothesis. For example, there is a difference between the average height of males and females. A parametric hypothesis test assumes that the data you want to test is (or approximately is) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normally distributed</a>. For example, height is normally distributed in a population. In addition, your data needs to be symmetrical since normally distributed data is symmetrical. If your data does not have the appropriate properties, then you use a non-parametric test.</p>
<p>There are different parametric tests, but the most common is the t-test. Below is the list of the four parametric hypothesis tests we will explore here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Z-test (Section&nbsp;2)</li>
<li>T-test (Section&nbsp;3)</li>
<li>F-test (Section&nbsp;4)</li>

<p>Besides deciding which hypothesis test to use to answer the question at hand, we also need to decide a couple of other parameters, for example, whether the test would be one sample or two samples, paired or un-paired, and one or two-tailed. Below is a brief description of each parameter.</p>
<section id="paired-vs.-unpaired-tests" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="paired-vs.-unpaired-tests">Paired vs.&nbsp;unpaired tests</h2>
<p>Paired tests are used to compare two related data groups, <em><strong>such as before and after measurements</strong>.</em> Unpaired tests are used to compare two unrelated data groups, such as men and women.</p>
</section>
<section id="one-sample-vs.-two-sample-tests" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="one-sample-vs.-two-sample-tests">One sample vs.&nbsp;two sample tests</h2>
<p>There are key differences between one-sample and two-sample hypothesis testing. Firstly, in one sample hypothesis testing, we are testing the mean of a single sample <strong><em>against a known population mean</em></strong>. In contrast, two-sample hypothesis testing involves <strong><em>comparing the means of two independent samples</em></strong>. Secondly, one-sample hypothesis testing only requires a single sample size, while two-sample hypothesis testing requires two. Finally, one-sample hypothesis testing is typically used when the population standard deviation is known, while two-sample hypothesis testing is used when the population standard deviation is unknown.</p>

<p>In a hypothesis test, the null and alternate hypotheses are stated in terms of population parameters. These hypotheses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Null hypothesis (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_0">): The value of the population parameter is equal to the hypothesized value.</li>
<li>The alternate hypothesis (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_1">): The value of the population parameter is not equal to the hypothesized value.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hypothesis test is based on a sample from the population. This sample is used to test the hypotheses by deriving a test statistic. Finally, the value of the test statistic is compared to a critical value. The critical value depends on the alpha level, which is the likelihood of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.</p>
<p>The null and alternate hypotheses determine the direction of the test. There are two types of hypothesis tests: <strong><em>one-tailed and two-tailed tests</em></strong>.</p>
<section id="one-tailed-test" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="one-tailed-test">One-tailed Test</h3>
<p>A one-tailed test is conducted when the null and alternate hypotheses are stated in terms of <strong><em>“greater than” or “less than”.</em></strong></p>
<p>For example, let’s say that a company wants to test a new advertising campaign. The null hypothesis (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_0">) is that the new campaign will have no effect on sales. The alternate hypothesis (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_1">) is that the new campaign will increase sales.</p>
<p>The null hypothesis is stated as:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_0"> : The population mean is less than or equal to 10%.</p>
<p>The alternate hypothesis is stated as:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_1"> : The population mean is greater than 10%.</p>
<p>The test is conducted by taking a sample of data and calculating the mean. Then, the mean is compared to the critical value. <strong><em>The null hypothesis is rejected if the mean is greater than the critical value.</em></strong></p>
</section>
<section id="two-tailed-test" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="two-tailed-test">Two-tailed Test</h3>
<p>A two-tailed test is conducted when the null and alternate hypotheses are stated in terms of <strong><em>“not equal to”.</em></strong></p>
<p>Taking our advertising campaign example. The null hypothesis (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_0">) is that the new campaign will have no effect on sales. The alternate hypothesis (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_1">) is that the new campaign will increase or decrease sales.</p>
<p>The null hypothesis is stated as:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_0"> : The population mean is equal to 10%.</p>
<p>The alternate hypothesis is stated as:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_1"> : The population mean is not equal to 10%.</p>
<p>The test is conducted by taking a sample of data and calculating the mean. Then, the mean is compared to the critical value. <strong><em>The null hypothesis is rejected if the mean is not equal to the critical value.</em></strong></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-method">The method</h2>
<p>No matter which hypothesis testing method is selected following are the steps that are executed:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Firstly, identify the null hypothesis <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_0:%5Cmu%20=%20%5Cmu_0"></li>
<li>Then identify the alternative hypothesis <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_1"> and decide if it is of the form <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_1%20:%20%5Cmu%20%5Cneq%20%5Cmu_0"> (a two-tailed test) or if there is a specific direction for how the mean changes <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_1%20:%20%5Cmu%20%3E%20%5Cmu_0"> or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?H_1%20:%20%5Cmu%20%3C%20%5Cmu_0">, (a one-tailed test).</li>
<li>Next, calculate the test statistic. Compare the test statistic to the critical values and obtain a range for the p-value which is the probability that the difference between the two groups is due to chance. The test is usually used with a significance level of 0.05, which means that there is a 5% chance that the difference between the two groups is due to chance. However, per recommendations from the American Statistical Association we need to be careful when we state statements like <strong><em>“<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/utas20/73/sup1">statistically significant</a>”</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Form conclusions. If your test statistic is greater than the critical values in the table, it is significant. You can reject the null hypothesis at that level, otherwise you accept it.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dataset">Dataset</h2>
<p>For our example exercises, we will use the dataset from Open Case Studies <a href="https://www.opencasestudies.org/ocs-bp-rural-and-urban-obesity"><strong><em>“exploring global patterns of obesity across rural and urban regions”</em></strong></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="wright">(Wright et al. 2020)</span> . Body mass index (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html">BMI</a>) is often used as a proxy for <strong>adiposity</strong> (the condition of having excess body fat) and is measured as an individual’s weight in kilograms (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?kg">) or pounds (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?lbs">) divided by the individual’s height in meters (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m%5E2">) squared. Recently, an article published in <em>Nature</em> evaluated and compared the BMI of populations in rural and urban communities around the world <span class="citation" data-cites="risingr2019">(<span>“Rising Rural Body-Mass Index Is the Main Driver of the Global Obesity Epidemic in Adults”</span> 2019)</span>. The article challenged the widely-held view that increased urbanization was one of the major reasons for increased global obesity rates. This view came about because many countries around the world have shown increased urbanization levels in parallel with increased obesity rates. In this article, however, the NCD-RisC argued that this might not be the case and that in fact for most regions around the world, BMI measurements are increasing in rural populations just as much, if not more so, than urban populations. Furthermore, this study suggested that obesity has particularly increased in female populations in rural regions:</p>

<p>“We noted a persistently higher rural BMI, especially for women.”</p>

<p>We will fetch the cleaned version of the data from the the <a href="https://github.com//opencasestudies/ocs-bp-rural-and-urban-obesity">Open Case Studies GitHub repository</a> as data wrangling is out of the scope of this tutorial.</p>

<h1>Z-test</h1>
<p>A z-test is used to compare two population means when the sample size is large and the population variance is known.</p>
<p>These are some conditions for using this type of test:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data must be <strong>normally distributed</strong>.</li>
<li>All data points must be <strong>independent</strong>.</li>
<li>For each sample the <strong>variances must be equal</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h1>T-test</h1>
<p>The t-test is used to determine whether two groups or one group and a known mean are significantly different from each other. The t-test can be used to compare means, or to compare proportions and can be used to compare two independent groups, or two dependent groups. The t-test is based on the t-statistic, which for a one group/sample where the mean for comparison is known is calculated using the following formula:</p>

<p>For the pooled variance t-test to be appropriate you rely on the assumption that the two samples come from the same population and have equal variance. However, a modification of the t-test known as Welch’s test is said to correct for this problem by estimating the variances, and adjusting the degrees of freedom to use in the test. This correction is performed by default, but can be shut off by using the <code>var.equal=TRUE</code> argument as used in the example above.</p>

<h1>F-test</h1>
<p>Conventionally in a hypothesis test the sample means are compared. However, it is possible to have two identical means for two different samples/groups, meanwhile their variances could differ drastically. The statistical test to use to compare variance is called the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F">-ratio test (or the variance ratio test) and compares two variances in order to test whether they come from the same populations.</p>
<p>Comparing two variances is useful in several cases, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When you want to perform a two samples t-test to check the equality of the variances of the two samples</p></li>
<li><p>When you want to compare the variability of a new measurement method to an old one. Does the new method reduce the variability of the measure?</p></li>
</ul>

Similarly to the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> and Normal distributions, it is organised according to the degrees of freedom of the two variance estimates. The degrees of freedom are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n_A%E2%88%921"> (for the numerator) and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n_B%E2%88%921"> (for the denominator).</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This post aims to lay down some rules that help name files and folders that are cross-platform, meaning they are acceptable across Linux, MacOS, and MS Windows, the three major operating systems. I have compiled these rules following international standards and recommendations from the US National Archives. Some rules mentioned here are exceptions to OS compatibility and are mentioned here from a useability point of view.</p>
<p>Having suitable files and folder naming can be helpful in data science, especially while working on the command line or programmatically querying large sets of files. For example, not having spaces in file names makes it easier to refer to them on the command line; having fixed delimiters in the file names can help iterate over files and fetch critical information programmatically.</p>

<section id="rules" class="level1">
<h1>Rules</h1>
<p>Use styles that are internationally recognized, easy to read by a human eye, and require fewer finger movements on the keyboard, for example, using lowercase letters that eliminate the shift key.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Use all lowercase letters (this doesn’t apply to OS compatibility).</li>
<li>Use hyphens (not underscores) to separate words. Avoid using spaces as they are difficult to work with on the command line.</li>
<li>Use YYYY-MM-DD format for dates.</li>
<li>While using the date at the beginning of a file name, keep the rest of the file name the same as the one created on a previous date (if there is more than one file for the same purpose, but it is sectioned according to the date.)</li>
<li>Use “.” only for file extensions.</li>
<li>Use v1, v2, …, vn to denote file versions. Ideally, one should use a version control system (VCS) such as Git.</li>
<li>For a stack of fewer than 100 files, number them as 00, 01, 02, …, 0n for easier sorting. Accordingly, for a stack of fewer than 1000 files, number them as 000, 001, 002, …, 00n.</li>
<li>File names should NOT contain punctuation, symbols, or special characters. ” / &nbsp;[ ] : ; | = _ , &lt; ? &gt; &amp; $ # ! ’ { } ( ).</li>

  <title>How to build a Singularity container for machine learning, data science, and chemistry</title>

<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><a href="https://apptainer.org/user-docs/3.8/">Singularity</a> is a free and open-source container platform for<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization">operating-system-level virtualization</a>. It allows you to create and run containers that package up pieces of software in a way that is portable and reproducible. You can build a container using Singularity on your laptop (preferably Linux) and then run it on your local computer or a High-Performance Computer (HPC). A Singularity container is a single file that is easy to ship to an HPC or a friend.</p>
<p>I heavily rely on Singularity for my work as I write arbitrary code that runs on an HPC. I often require a specific set of libraries, compilers, or other supporting software that are often hard to manage on an HPC. Also, from a reproducibility point of view, it’s easier to build a container with a fixed library and software version packaged in a single file than scattered in multiple modules on the HPC. And when the time comes for the publication, I can easily share the container on Zenodo, etc.</p>
<p>The title of this post emphasizes data science, machine learning, and chemistry because all the software we will install is related to these disciplines. However, this procedure applies to building containers for any field of application.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>R and Python, the two most popular data science and machine learning programming languages, come with a default data set for demonstration and educational purposes. Moreover, many popular data science libraries such as tidyverse, lme4, nlme, MASS, survival, Bioconductor, and sklearn, amongst others, also contain example datasets for unit testing and demonstration. However, even though the included data are carefully selected, most of them are old (from the 1970s and ’80s) and hence limited in sample size (due to the limitation in the then available computing power) and may not be more than a toy example in the current context. Therefore, in a learning path after utilizing the default datasets for initial testing of a statistical function or a machine learning model, it’s both desired and recommended to practice on a real-life dataset. Working on a real-life dataset that is apt in the current context of data science and computing resources would not only teach the desired statistical/machine learning technique but also expose the learner to challenges that are usually not associated with toy datasets—for example, class imbalance, missing values, wrongly labeled datatypes, statistical noise, etc.</p>
<p>For a real-life dataset, I recommend using open data released by government agencies and other non-government organizations as part of their openness in operations. These datasets are not only of adequate size but also represent what is happening around us in a field of interest. Many countries around the world release data to inform citizens about their operations and fair practices. However, I do not think, other than the established data analytics-based companies and research groups, ordinary citizens ever look into such resources. I bet many would not even know that their government agencies are making ample amounts of data available for scrutiny. Therefore, in my opinion, budding data scientists should take it upon themselves to utilize these datasets in place of toy examples to not only justify the existence of such a resource but also, through analysis, gain first-hand insight and transfer it to their friends, family, and broader audience. Such a practice by amateur data scientists may have far-reaching implications than what I can convey here.</p>
<p>In the sections below, for completeness, I will briefly discuss how to access default datasets available in R and then move on to other resources, including open government data mentioned earlier.</p>

<h1>Open government data</h1>
<p>As I mentioned in the introduction, many governments worldwide release data for transparency and accountability; for example, <a href="https://data.gov" class="uri">https://data.gov</a>, the US federal government’s open data site. Data.gov also maintains a list of websites at <a href="https://data.gov/open-gov/" class="uri">https://data.gov/open-gov/</a> pointing to data repositories related to US cities and counties, US states, and international countries and regions. The primary aim of these repositories is to publish information online as open data using standardized, machine-readable data formats with their metadata.</p>
<p>Depending upon the type of data requested, most of the data can be downloaded in multiple machine-readable formats either via the export option on the website or programmatically through APIs (see section Section&nbsp;2.4). For example for tabular data popular formats include CSV, XML, RDF, JSON, and XML.</p>
<p>Interactive and exportable tables below show the list of websites at <a href="https://data.gov/open-gov/" class="uri">https://data.gov/open-gov/</a>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-marylandapi">An example of using Maryland state open data via an API</h2>
<p>Since I live and work in Maryland, I want to see how wages in Maryland and its counties have changed over time. I also want to test if Montgomery county (where I live) has different wages compared to Frederick, Howard, and Prince George’s counties which borders Montgomery on the north, east, and south sides. Therefore, in this example, I will fetch <a href="https://opendata.maryland.gov/Demographic/Maryland-Average-Wage-Per-Job-Current-Dollars-2010/mk5a-nf44">Maryland Average Wage Per Job (Current Dollars): 2010-2020</a> data via API using <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSocrata/index.html">RSocrata library</a> in R and carry out some analysis.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/" class="uri">https://dev.socrata.com/</a> to learn more about how to work with open data APIs in various programming languages.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In Table&nbsp;2, each row has an average wage for a year for Maryland, and each of its counties (columns) from 2010-2020 and Figure&nbsp;1 shows the same data as a line graph depicting the change in wages (y-axis) over time (x-axis).</p>
<p>Table&nbsp;3 lists the results of an unpaired two-sample t-test between wages from Montgomery and Frederick, Howard, and Prince George’s counties. As you can see from the t-test results, wages differ between Montgomery and Frederick, Howard, and Prince George’s counties, with Montogomery county residents earning higher than all its three bordering counties.</p>

<h1>Kaggle</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> is a website that hosts data science and machine learning competitions. Users can compete to win prizes, and the site also has a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">public dataset repository</a>. In addition to hosting competitions and disseminating public datasets, Kaggle also hosts tutorials and Jupyter-like notebook environments for Python and R runtimes. Users can clone an existing notebook on Kaggle, create it from scratch or upload it from their local computer and provision free hardware resources, including GPUs, to execute their notebooks.</p>
<p>While uploading public datasets, users can also generate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">DOI</a> for their dataset to give them a permanent identifier on the internet. For example, I am distributing “Classify the bitter or sweet taste of compounds” <span class="citation" data-cites="rohitfarmer2022a">(Rohit Farmer 2022a)</span> and “Tweets from heads of governments and states” <span class="citation" data-cites="rohitfarmer2022">(Rohit Farmer 2022b)</span> datasets on Kaggle for classification and natural language processing analysis, respectively.</p>
<p>Datasets on Kaggle can be downloaded using a web browser or via its API, which also interacts with its competition environment. Users can find datasets for various statical and machine learning tasks available in various formats, including CSVs, MS Excel, images, SQLite databases, pandas pickle, etc.</p>

<p>I am still determining if Kaggle datasets similar to the ones from Zenodo, Figshare, and Dryad (mentioned in the section Section&nbsp;4) are used in research/scientific studies or only in testing and learning data science. If you know the answer, then please put it in the comments.</p>
</div>

<section id="sec-zenodo" class="level1">
<h1>Zenodo, Figshare, and Dryad</h1>
<p>In contrast to Kaggle (mentioned in section Section&nbsp;3) which is mainly a competition hosting and data science learning community <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>, <a href="https://figshare.com/">Fighsare</a>, and <a href="https://datadryad.org/">Dryad</a> are data hosting platforms primarily used by scientists and researchers to serve data, manuscripts, and articles. The data hosted on these three platforms usually do not qualify for a domain-specific data respository or too large to attach as supplementary material to an article. They also aim to serve as a long-term archiving solution; therefore, even if the data/manuscript is published elsewhere under the correct licensing term, it can be redistributed here.</p>
<p>Zenodo is a digital repository that allows users to upload and share digital content such as datasets, software, and research papers. Zenodo is designed to preserve and provide long-term access to digital content. Zenodo is developed and operated by OpenAIRE, a European consortium that promotes open access to research. A unique feature of Zenodo is to archive releases from a GitHub repository and provide a DOI making it easier to cite a GitHub repository, for example, <span class="citation" data-cites="farmer2022">(Farmer 2022b)</span>. Another excellent feature is the ability to create communities to organize data and manuscripts of a similar kind. Anyone can create a community, and the owner can accept or reject a request for an item to be indexed in their community, for example, <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/data-all-the-way/" class="uri">https://zenodo.org/communities/data-all-the-way/</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="callout-caption-container flex-fill">
Tip
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Besides data and manuscripts, Zenodo can also be utilized to archive a blog post and generate a DOI, for example, <span class="citation" data-cites="farmer2022a">(Farmer 2022a)</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Like Zenodo, Figshare is a web-based platform for storing, sharing, and managing research data. Figshare also provides a unique identifier (DOI) for each data set, which can be used to cite the data set in publications. Data can be stored privately or publicly, and Figshare provides tools for managing data access and permissions. Data scientists and machine learning engineers often use Figshare to share data sets and models with collaborators or the public.</p>
<p>Dryad is also a digital repository primarily used for scientific and medical data associated with a publication in a scholarly journal. Dryad makes data discoverable, usable, and citable by integrating it into the scholarly publication process.</p>
<p>Zenodo, Figshare, and Dryad are available to anyone to upload data (download is always free and allowed); however, limitations may apply to the file size uploaded or the private vs.&nbsp;public data status. Additionally, many educational/research institutions may partner with one or all of these platforms, thus providing enhanced options.</p>

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p><strong>Unlike open government data sources that are primarily used to download data, Kaggle, Zenodo, Figshare, and Dryad can be used to find the suitable dataset for your analysis and share your curated dataset publicly in a permanent citable manner.</strong></p>

<p>2022-10-18 Typo correction and included a list of links to learn more about Google Colab.<br>

<p>I recently came across <a href="https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold">ColabFold</a> <span class="citation" data-cites="mirdita2022">(Mirdita et al. 2022)</span>, a slimmer and faster implementation of AlphaFold2 <span class="citation" data-cites="jumper2021">(Jumper et al. 2021)</span> (the famous protein structure prediction software from <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphafold">DeepMind</a>) implemented on Google Colab in the form of a Jupyter notebook, giving it an easy-to-use web server-like interface. I found this idea intriguing as it removes the overhead of maintaining a webserver while providing a web-based graphical user interface.</p>
<p>Google Colab is a free (with options for pro subscriptions) Jupyter notebook environment for Python (R indirectly) provided by Google that runs on unoccupied Google servers. This free resource also includes access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">GPU</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_Processing_Unit">TPU</a> making it attractive to various machine learning and data science tasks. For the most part, Google Colab is utilized in machine learning and data science education. However, following the example of ColabFold and my implementation of <a href="https://github.com/rohitfarmer/ColabHDStIM">ColabHDStIM</a>, I want to make a case that it can also be used for providing an easy-to-use interface or live demo for scientific software without maintaining the complex infrastructure of a web server.</p>
<p>Coming from a bioinformatics/computational biology background, I know there is a craze for developing web servers worldwide. However, although many web servers are created yearly, many groups, especially in developing countries, lack the resources to build one. On the flip side, many of these initially well-funded web servers are either of low quality, are not kept updated, or go offline soon after the publication, thus squandering the resources <span class="citation" data-cites="veretnik2008 schultheiss2011 kern2020">(Veretnik, Fink, and Bourne 2008; Schultheiss et al. 2011; Kern, Fehlmann, and Keller 2020)</span>. Therefore, there is a need for an alternative where scientists can distribute their software in an easy-to-use interface like interactive notebooks. Even if the notebook environments are limited in executing production-scale software, they can still be utilized to provide a live demo on a minimal dataset. In my opinion, it is better than the vignettes accompanying software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are some pros and cons of using Google Colab.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to implement</li>
<li>Free hardware resources from Google, including GPU and TPU</li>
<li>Option to buy more resources from Google as per need</li>
<li>While hosted on Google’s server, the same notebook can be executed using a local runtime to take advantage of local hardware resources.</li>
<li>Forkable and hackable if the original maintainer stops the development.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Free hardware resources can be limiting</li>
<li>Uploading and downloading data to a Colab is slow and require a workaround</li>
<li>All the instances are transient; therefore, on every restart, all the required software is re-installed, which takes time.</li>
<li>Colab notebooks are meant to run interactively; therefore, maintaining a long background session is hard or impossible.</li>
<li>Colab primarily supports Python and requires workarounds to support other languages.</li>

<h1>Context</h1>
<p>Throughout human evolution, we have been drawn toward sweet-tasting foods and averted from bitter tastes - sweet is good or desirable, bitter is undesirable, ear wax or medicinal. Therefore, a better understanding of molecular features that determine the bitter-sweet taste of substances is crucial for identifying natural and synthetic compounds for various purposes.</p>
</section>
<section id="sources" class="level1">
<h1>Sources</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dsv/4234193">This dataset</a> is adapted from <a href="https://github.com/cosylabiiit/bittersweet" class="uri">https://github.com/cosylabiiit/bittersweet</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-43664-y" class="uri">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-43664-y</a>. In chemoinformatics, molecules are often represented as compact <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system">SMILES</a> strings. In this dataset, SMILES structures, along with their names and targets (bitter, sweet, tasteless, and non-bitter), were obtained from the original study. Subsequently, SMILES were converted into canonical SMILES using RDKit, and the features (molecular descriptors, both 2D and 3D) were calculated using <a href="https://github.com/mordred-descriptor/mordred">Mordred</a>. Secondly, tasteless and non-bitter categories were merged into a single category of non-bitter-sweet. Finally, since many of the compounds were missing names, IUPAC names were fetched using <a href="https://pubchempy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PubChemPy</a> for all the compounds, and for still missing names, a generic compound + incrementor name was assigned.</p>
</section>
<section id="inspiration" class="level1">
<h1>Inspiration</h1>
<p>This is a classification dataset with the first three columns carrying names, SMILES, and canonical SMILES. Any of these columns can be used to refer to a molecule. The fourth column is the target (taste category). And all numeric features are from the 5th column until the end of the file. Many features have cells with string annotations due to errors produced by Mordred. Therefore, the following data science techniques can be learned while working on this dataset:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Data cleanup</li>
<li>Features selection (since the number of features is quite large in proportion to the data points)</li>
<li>Feature scaling/transformation/normalization</li>
<li>Dimensionality reduction</li>
<li>Binomial classification (bitter vs.&nbsp;sweet) - utilize non-bitter-sweet as a negative class.</li>
<li>Multinomial classification (bitter vs.&nbsp;sweet vs.&nbsp;non-bitter-sweet)</li>
<li>Since SMILES can be converted into molecular graphs, graph-based modeling should also be possible.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="initial-data-preparation" class="level1">
<h1>Initial data preparation</h1>
<p>A copy of the original dataset and the scripts and notebooks used to convert SMILES to canonical SMILES, generate features, fetch names, and export the final TSV file for Kaggle is loosely maintained at <a href="https://github.com/rohitfarmer/bittersweet" class="uri">https://github.com/rohitfarmer/bittersweet</a>.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>To download a shared file with “anyone with the link” access rights from Google Drive in R, we can utilize the <code>googledrive</code> library from the <code>tidyverse</code> package. The method described here will utilize the file ID copied from the shared link. Typically <code>googledrive</code> package is used to work with a Google Drive of an authenticated user. However, since we are downloading a publicly shared file in this tutorial, we will work without user authentication. So, please follow the steps below.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1-copy-the-file-id-from-the-share-link.">Step 1: Copy the file ID from the share link.</h2>
<p>Below is a share link from my Google Drive pointing to an R data frame.</p>
<p><code>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vj607etanUVYzVFj_HXkznHTd0Ltv_Y4/view?usp=sharing</code></p>
<p>This string <code>1vj607etanUVYzVFj_HXkznHTd0Ltv_Y4</code> is the file ID that we will use to download.</p>

<p>Since October 2018, I have been maintaining a bot written in Python and running on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ that collects tweets from heads of governments (worldwide) followed by <a href="https://twitter.com/headoffice" class="uri">https://twitter.com/headoffice</a>. It was an excellent exercise learning Python, Twitter API, SQLite database, and using a Raspberry Pi for hobby projects. I have now released the data on Kaggle at <a href="https://doi.org/10.34740/KAGGLE/DSV/4208877" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.34740/KAGGLE/DSV/4208877</a> for the community to use.</p>
<p>The dataset contains an Excel workbook per year with data points on the rows and features on the columns. Features include the timestamp (UTC), language in which the tweet is written, user id, user name, tweet id, and tweet text. The first version includes the data from October 2018 until September 15, 2022. After that, future releases will be quarterly. It is a textual dataset and is primarily useful for analyses related to natural language processing.</p>
<p>In the Kaggle submission, I have also included a notebook (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/rohitfarmer/dont-run-tweet-collection-and-preprocessing" class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/code/rohitfarmer/dont-run-tweet-collection-and-preprocessing</a>) with the Python code that collected the tweets and the additional code that I used to pre-process the data before submission. After releasing the first data set, I updated the code and moved the bot from Python to R using the <code>rtweet</code> library instead of <code>tweepy</code>. I found <code>rtweet</code> to perform better, especially in filtering out duplicated tweets.</p>
<p>In the current setup (<a href="https://github.com/rohitfarmer/government-tweets" class="uri">https://github.com/rohitfarmer/government-tweets</a>) that is still running on my Raspberry Pi 3B+, the main bot script runs every fifteen minutes via <code>crontab</code> and fetches data that is more recent than the latest tweet collected in the previous run. The data is stored in an SQLite database which is backed up to MEGA cloud storage via Rclone once every midnight ET.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the process of creating the bot and being able to run it for a couple of years, and I hope I will soon find some time to look into the data and fetch some exciting insights. But, until then, the data is available to the data science community to utilize as they please. So, please open a discussion on the Kaggle page for questions, comments, or collaborations.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Data transformation is a process of performing a mathematical function on each data point used in a statistical or machine learning analysis to either satisfy the underlying assumptions of a statistical test (e.g., normal distribution for a t-test), help a machine-learning algorithm to converge faster and or make a visualization interpretable. In addition to statistical analyses and modeling, data transformation can also be helpful in data visualization, for example, performing a log transformation on a skewed data set to plot it in a relatively unskewed and visually appealing scatter plot. Most of the data transformation methods are invertible and original values of a data set can be recovered by implementing a counter mathematical function. In mathematical form it can be expressed as:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x'%20=%20f(x)"></p>
<p>Where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> is the original data, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x'"> is the transformed data, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(x)"> is a mathematical function performed on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x">.</p>
<p>In data science, data transformation is also sometimes combined with the data cleaning step. In addition to performing a mathematical function to the data points, they are also checked for quality, for example, checking for missing values. I will discuss data cleaning procedures elsewhere. Data transformation can be considered as an umbrella term for both data scaling and data normalization. They are frequently used interchangeably, sometimes referring to the same mathematical operation. Although data scaling and normalization are used to achieve a similar result, it is better to understand them as two different operations that are happening under the hood.</p>
<p>Although every data transformation method performs a mathematical operation on every data point (e.i. element wise), for some, this operation is not influenced if data points are either removed or added to the data set. Let’s consider a data set in the form of a two-dimensional data table with samples on the row and features on the column. Now take two methods to compare 1) log transformation 2) min-max scaling. In log transformation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?log(x)">, a log is taken for every data point individually, and the result will not change if some rows or columns are dropped or added in our example data table. However, in min-max scaling</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x'%20=%20x-min(x)/max(x)-min(x)"></p>
<p>that is performed feature-wise (columns); if the data point that was selected as a min or max in a previous transformation is removed, then re-doing the transformation will change the result. The removal of a data point may happen; for example, if the min or max value selected in the first iteration was an outlier or that a particular sample had multiple missing values, and therefore, it had to be removed, amongst others. Min-max scaling will also influence if more data points are added to our data set. It may bring a new min or max data point and hence will change the scaling. Therefore while selecting a data transformation method, it must be noted if data points are dropped in the subsequent analysis, then should you perform the transformation again as a result of data point loss or it will be indifferent.</p>
</section>
<section id="element-wise-data-transformation" class="level1">
<h1>Element Wise Data Transformation</h1>
<p>As mentioned in the general introduction above, element wise data transformation happens per element without utilizing any information from the rest of the elements in a feature (column) or in a sample (row). These methods are therefore immune to any change in the size of the data hence if some features or samples are removed after the transformation will not affect the subsequent analysis.</p>
<section id="log-transformation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="log-transformation">Log Transformation</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm">log</a> transformation, logarithm is calculated for every value in the data set. Traditionally, log transformation is carried out to reduce the skewness of data or to bring data closer to a normal distribution. Usually the base to the log doesn’t matter unless it is a domain specific requirement. However, every feature of the data set should be transformed with the same base. Most of the programming languages have a core function to calculate the log of a number. In programming languages that support vector operation, for example, R, the same log function can be performed on both a single value or on all the values within a data frame, vector or matrix.</p>
<p>For example, let’s visualize the effect of log transformation on a synthetically generated dummy data. To generated figures Figure&nbsp;1 and Figure&nbsp;2, I have randomly sampled 10,000 positive real numbers from a skewed (positive and negative) normal distribution and performed a log transformation on every data point. The left sub-panel shows a histogram of the non-transformed data, and the right sub-panel shows a histogram of the log-transformed data. Although log transformation is known for reducing the skewness of the data and making the distribution more symmetric around the mean, it holds only for the positively skewed data. If the data are negatively skewed a log transformation will skew it further. In case of a negatively skewed data doing a power transformation may help to reduce the skewness (figure Figure&nbsp;3). Usually raising the data to a power of 2 has slight effect on the skewness; a higher number may be required. In addition to the visual inspection, we can also numerically quantify the skewness of the data; that is mentioned in the figure caption.</p>

<p>Log transformation can only be performed on positive values. Mathematics principles doesn’t allow log calculation on negative values. In case our input data contains negative values and a log like transformation is desired inverse hyperbolic sin (arcsinh) transformation method can be used.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="arcsinh-transformation">Arcsinh Transformation</h2>
<p><a href="http://people.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/abramowitz_and_stegun.pdf">Inverse hyperbolic sin</a> transformation is a non-linear transformation that is often used in situations where a log transformations can’t be used; such as in the presence of negative values. <a href="https://support.cytobank.org/hc/en-us/articles/206148057-About-the-Arcsinh-transform">Flow and mass cytometry</a> are popular examples where arcsinh transformation is a almost always a method of choice. Reason being older flow cytometry machines produced positive values that were displayed on a log scale. However, newer machines can produce both negative and positive values that can’t be displayed on a log scale. Therefore, to keep the data resemble a log transformation arcsinh transformation is used.</p>
<p>Arcsinh transformation can also be tweaked by using a cofactor to behave differently around zero. For both negative and positive values starting from zero to cofactor are presented in a linear fashion along the lines of raw data values and values beyond he cofactor are presented in a log like fashion. In flow and mass cytometry a cofactor of 150 and 5 are used respectively.</p>
<p>For all real x: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?arcsinh(x)%20=%20log(x%20+%20%5Csqrt%7Bx%5E2%20+%201%7D)"></p>
<p>Let’s use similar positively skewed data as in the log transformation to visualize how an arcsinh transformation affects the shape of the distribution. The only change that I would want to do in this data set is to add few negative values. As I mentioned earlier that our mathematical laws doesn’t allow us to take log on negative numbers arcsinh transformation is capable of transforming small negative values closer to zero. Figures Figure&nbsp;4 and Figure&nbsp;5 show the histograms comparing the original and the arcsinh transformed data for positive and negatively skewed data respectively. From the figures it’s evident that unlike log, arcsinh transformation works on both positively and negatively skewed data equally well.</p>

<h1>Feature Wise Data Scaling</h1>
<p>Data scaling is a type of data transformation that usually doesn’t affect the distribution of the data but change the scale on which the numerical values are presented. For example, if a distribution is normally distributed then it will stay normally distributed after the transformation however, if the numbers range from say 10 to 100 they may be re-scaled from 0 to 1. The relative difference between the numbers will remain the same. Such type of transformation is useful when the features in the data set are measured on different scales. For example in a data set that records height, weight, and time taken to finish a 100 meter sprint for 20 high school boys height would probably range from 4 to 6 ft, weight from 40 to 80 kg and sprint time from 10 to 30 seconds. You can see although they are all positive real numbers but they have different units and also different scales on which they are measured. In this particular example none of the ranges even overlap. Such kind of data sometimes becomes very difficult for machine learning algorithms to work with in particular for gradient decent algorithms to converge in a reasonable number of iterations. Therefore, having all the features on the same scale becomes desirable if not essential.</p>
<p>There are two common ways to get all the features to have the same scale: min-max scaling and standardization.</p>
<section id="min-max-scaling" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="min-max-scaling">Min-Max Scaling</h2>
<p>In min-max scaling for a given feature, we subtract the minimum value from each value and divide the residual by the difference between the maximum and the minimum value. The resulting transformed data is scaled between 0 and 1.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?minmax(x)%20=%20x%20-%20min(x)%20/%20max(x)%20-%20min(x)"></p>
<p>Min-max scaling can also be modified to scale the values to the desired range, for example, between -1 and 1.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?minmax(x)%20=%20((b%20-%20a)%20*%20(x%20-%20min(x))%20/%20max(x)%20-%20min(x))%20+%20%20a"></p>
<p>Where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b"> are the minimum and maximum range respectively.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="standardization">Standardization</h2>
<p>Standardization is also known as z-scaling, mean removal, or variance scaling. In standardization, the goal is to scale the data with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?z%20=%20(x%20-%20%5Cmu)/%5Csigma"></p>
<p>Where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu"> is the mean and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> is the standard deviation of a given feature. Then, the distribution of the transformed data is called the z-distribution.</p>

<section id="data-normalization" class="level1">
<h1>Data Normalization</h1>
<p>In data science, we casually use the term data normalization for any method that transforms the data across the samples or features so that the data’s elements (samples or features) are similar and comparable. For example, in the case of gene expression measurements for multiple samples, we want to detect actual biological differences between the samples than the technical variations caused by human errors in handling samples. Therefore, having normalized data ensures that the differentially expressed genes we detect are due to biological conditions and not technical noise.</p>
<p>However, I like to consider normalization methods different from element-wise transformation or feature-wise scaling as changing the dataset requires re-normalization. As in the gene expression example, quantile normalization is frequently used and sensitive to changes in the samples and the features. Unlike element-wise transformation, where neither a sample nor a feature affects the transformation, or in feature-wise scaling, where dropping a feature would not affect the scaling of other features.</p>
<p>Therefore, this section will look into methods that are unlike element-wise transformation or feature-wise scaling.</p>
<section id="quantile-normalization" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quantile-normalization">Quantile Normalization</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile_normalization">Quantile normalization</a> (QN) is a technique to make two distribution identical in statistical properties. QN involves first ranking the feature of each sample by magnitude, calculating the average value for genes occupying the same rank, and then substituting the values of all genes occupying that particular rank with this average value. The next step is to reorder the features of each sample in their original order.</p>
