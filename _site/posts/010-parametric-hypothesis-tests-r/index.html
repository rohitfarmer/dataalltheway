<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>A hypothesis test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is enough evidence to support a hypothesis. For example, there is a difference between the average height of males and females. A parametric hypothesis test assumes that the data you want to test is (or approximately is) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normally distributed</a>. For example, height is normally distributed in a population. In addition, your data needs to be symmetrical since normally distributed data is symmetrical. If your data does not have the appropriate properties, then you use a non-parametric test.</p>
<p>There are different parametric tests, but the most common is the t-test. Below is the list of the four parametric hypothesis tests we will explore here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Z-test (<a href="#sec-z-test">Section&nbsp;2</a>)</li>
<li>T-test (<a href="#sec-t-test">Section&nbsp;3</a>)</li>
<li>F-test (<a href="#sec-f-test">Section&nbsp;4</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides deciding which hypothesis test to use to answer the question at hand, we also need to decide a couple of other parameters, for example, whether the test would be one sample or two samples, paired or un-paired, and one or two-tailed. Below is a brief description of each parameter.</p>
<section id="paired-vs.-unpaired-tests" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="paired-vs.-unpaired-tests">Paired vs.&nbsp;unpaired tests</h2>
<p>Paired tests are used to compare two related data groups, <em><strong>such as before and after measurements</strong>.</em> Unpaired tests are used to compare two unrelated data groups, such as men and women.</p>
</section>
<section id="one-sample-vs.-two-sample-tests" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="one-sample-vs.-two-sample-tests">One sample vs.&nbsp;two sample tests</h2>
<p>There are key differences between one-sample and two-sample hypothesis testing. Firstly, in one sample hypothesis testing, we are testing the mean of a single sample <strong><em>against a known population mean</em></strong>. In contrast, two-sample hypothesis testing involves <strong><em>comparing the means of two independent samples</em></strong>. Secondly, one-sample hypothesis testing only requires a single sample size, while two-sample hypothesis testing requires two. Finally, one-sample hypothesis testing is typically used when the population standard deviation is known, while two-sample hypothesis testing is used when the population standard deviation is unknown.</p>
</section>
<section id="one-vs.-two-tailed-tests" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="one-vs.-two-tailed-tests">One vs.&nbsp;two tailed tests</h2>
<p>In a hypothesis test, the null and alternate hypotheses are stated in terms of population parameters. These hypotheses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Null hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>): The value of the population parameter is equal to the hypothesized value.</li>
<li>The alternate hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>): The value of the population parameter is not equal to the hypothesized value.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hypothesis test is based on a sample from the population. This sample is used to test the hypotheses by deriving a test statistic. Finally, the value of the test statistic is compared to a critical value. The critical value depends on the alpha level, which is the likelihood of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.</p>
<p>The null and alternate hypotheses determine the direction of the test. There are two types of hypothesis tests: <strong><em>one-tailed and two-tailed tests</em></strong>.</p>
<section id="one-tailed-test" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="one-tailed-test">One-tailed Test</h3>
<p>A one-tailed test is conducted when the null and alternate hypotheses are stated in terms of <strong><em>“greater than” or “less than”.</em></strong></p>
<p>For example, let’s say that a company wants to test a new advertising campaign. The null hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) is that the new campaign will have no effect on sales. The alternate hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>) is that the new campaign will increase sales.</p>
<p>The null hypothesis is stated as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> : The population mean is less than or equal to 10%.</p>
<p>The alternate hypothesis is stated as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> : The population mean is greater than 10%.</p>
<p>The test is conducted by taking a sample of data and calculating the mean. Then, the mean is compared to the critical value. <strong><em>The null hypothesis is rejected if the mean is greater than the critical value.</em></strong></p>
</section>
<section id="two-tailed-test" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="two-tailed-test">Two-tailed Test</h3>
<p>A two-tailed test is conducted when the null and alternate hypotheses are stated in terms of <strong><em>“not equal to”.</em></strong></p>
<p>Taking our advertising campaign example. The null hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) is that the new campaign will have no effect on sales. The alternate hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>) is that the new campaign will increase or decrease sales.</p>
<p>The null hypothesis is stated as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> : The population mean is equal to 10%.</p>
<p>The alternate hypothesis is stated as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> : The population mean is not equal to 10%.</p>
<p>The test is conducted by taking a sample of data and calculating the mean. Then, the mean is compared to the critical value. <strong><em>The null hypothesis is rejected if the mean is not equal to the critical value.</em></strong></p>

<section id="the-method" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-method">The method</h2>
<p>No matter which hypothesis testing method is selected following are the steps that are executed:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Firstly, identify the null hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0:\mu = \mu_0\)</span></li>
<li>Then identify the alternative hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> and decide if it is of the form <span class="math inline">\(H_1 : \mu \neq \mu_0\)</span> (a two-tailed test) or if there is a specific direction for how the mean changes <span class="math inline">\(H_1 : \mu &gt; \mu_0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(H_1 : \mu &lt; \mu_0\)</span>, (a one-tailed test).</li>
<li>Next, calculate the test statistic. Compare the test statistic to the critical values and obtain a range for the p-value which is the probability that the difference between the two groups is due to chance. The test is usually used with a significance level of 0.05, which means that there is a 5% chance that the difference between the two groups is due to chance. However, per recommendations from the American Statistical Association we need to be careful when we state statements like <strong><em>“<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/utas20/73/sup1">statistically significant</a>”</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Form conclusions. If your test statistic is greater than the critical values in the table, it is significant. You can reject the null hypothesis at that level, otherwise you accept it.</li>
</ol>

<section id="dataset" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dataset">Dataset</h2>
<p>For our example exercises, we will use the dataset from Open Case Studies <a href="https://www.opencasestudies.org/ocs-bp-rural-and-urban-obesity"><strong><em>“exploring global patterns of obesity across rural and urban regions”</em></strong></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="wright">(<a href="#ref-wright" role="doc-biblioref">Wright et al. 2020</a>)</span> . Body mass index (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html">BMI</a>) is often used as a proxy for <strong>adiposity</strong> (the condition of having excess body fat) and is measured as an individual’s weight in kilograms (<span class="math inline">\(kg\)</span>) or pounds (<span class="math inline">\(lbs\)</span>) divided by the individual’s height in meters (<span class="math inline">\(m^2\)</span>) squared. Recently, an article published in <em>Nature</em> evaluated and compared the BMI of populations in rural and urban communities around the world <span class="citation" data-cites="risingr2019">(<a href="#ref-risingr2019" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“Rising Rural Body-Mass Index Is the Main Driver of the Global Obesity Epidemic in Adults”</span> 2019</a>)</span>. The article challenged the widely-held view that increased urbanization was one of the major reasons for increased global obesity rates. This view came about because many countries around the world have shown increased urbanization levels in parallel with increased obesity rates. In this article, however, the NCD-RisC argued that this might not be the case and that in fact for most regions around the world, BMI measurements are increasing in rural populations just as much, if not more so, than urban populations. Furthermore, this study suggested that obesity has particularly increased in female populations in rural regions:</p>

<li>All data points must be <strong>independent</strong>.</li>
<li>For each sample the <strong>variances must be equal</strong>.</li>

<h1>T-test</h1>
<p>The t-test is used to determine whether two groups or one group and a known mean are significantly different from each other. The t-test can be used to compare means, or to compare proportions and can be used to compare two independent groups, or two dependent groups. The t-test is based on the t-statistic, which for a one group/sample where the mean for comparison is known is calculated using the following formula:</p>
<p><span id="eq-t-test"><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation} t = \dfrac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\sqrt{\dfrac{s^2}{n}}} \end{equation}

<h1>F-test</h1>
<p>Conventionally in a hypothesis test the sample means are compared. However, it is possible to have two identical means for two different samples/groups, meanwhile their variances could differ drastically. The statistical test to use to compare variance is called the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-ratio test (or the variance ratio test) and compares two variances in order to test whether they come from the same populations.</p>
<p>Comparing two variances is useful in several cases, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When you want to perform a two samples t-test to check the equality of the variances of the two samples</p></li>
<li><p>When you want to compare the variability of a new measurement method to an old one. Does the new method reduce the variability of the measure?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="eq-f-test"><span class="math display">\[
F = \frac{S_A^2}{S_B^2}
\tag{8}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(S^2_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S^2_B\)</span> are the two variances to compare. There is a table of the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-distribution. Similarly to the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and Normal distributions, it is organised according to the degrees of freedom of the two variance estimates. The degrees of freedom are <span class="math inline">\(n_A−1\)</span> (for the numerator) and <span class="math inline">\(n_B−1\)</span> (for the denominator).</p>
