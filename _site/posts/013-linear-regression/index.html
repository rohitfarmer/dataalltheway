<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The relationship between dietary habits, blood glucose and insulin levels among people without cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes; the ATTICA study;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Diet has long been associated with a risk of insulin resistance and poor glycemic control. We sought to investigate the association between food groups and indices of glycemic control in adults without type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. METHODS: During 2001 - 2002 we randomly enrolled 1514 men (18-87 years old) and 1528 women (18-89 years old) without evidence of cardiovascular disease from the Attica area of Greece. Of them, 118 men and 92 women were excluded from the present analysis due to a history of diabetes mellitus (type 2). Fasting blood glucose and insulin levels were measured, while dietary habits were evaluated through a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Red meat consumption was positively associated with hyperglycemia (p = 0.04), hyperinsulinemia (p = 0.04), and HOMA levels (p = 0.03), even after adjusting for BMI and various other potential confounders. The intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, yogurt and other dairy products was not associated with levels of glycemic control indices. CONCLUSIONS: A higher consumption of red meat and its products may aggravate hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in non-diabetic people.;,citation_author=Demosthenes B Panagiotakos;,citation_author=Natalia Tzima;,citation_author=Christos Pitsavos;,citation_author=Christina Chrysohoou;,citation_author=Emilia Papakonstantinou;,citation_author=Antonis Zampelas;,citation_author=Christodoulos Stefanadis;,citation_publication_date=2005;,citation_cover_date=2005;,citation_year=2005;,citation_issue=4;,citation_volume=2;,citation_journal_title=Rev.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Development of regression model to predicting yield strength for different steel grades;,citation_abstract=Abstract Yield strength of steel is an important property in designing a steel component. The maximum load that material can sustain without undergoing permanent deformation is represented by yield strength. A robust model is purposed, which can accurately predict the yield strength of different steel grades, based on the varying chemical composition of steel from the employed database. The dataset consisting of chemical composition and experimental yield strength of steel rods from a collapsed building sites. MATLAB was used to generate a regression model such as multivariate regression and linear regression, to predict the yield strength values for different steel grades. A comparative study among the different regression models for RMS error, Max error, and highest accuracy is discussed in this paper.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors/features). It is one of the most widely used techniques in predictive modeling and is often used to understand the underlying relationship between different variables and to make predictions based on this relationship.</p>
<p>In linear regression, the goal is to find the <strong>line of best fit</strong> that minimizes the distance between the data points and the line. The line is represented by the equation <span id="eq-ymxc"><span class="math display">\[Y = mX + b \tag{1}\]</span></span> <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is the dependent variable, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the independent variable, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the slope of the line, and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the intercept. The slope represents the change in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> for a given change in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and the intercept is the point at which the line crosses the <span class="math inline">\(Y-axis\)</span>.</p>
<p>To understand the mathematical reasoning behind linear regression, consider the simple example:</p>
<p>Suppose we have a dataset containing the weight and heights of a group of individuals. We can plot the data on a scatter plot and observe the relationship between weight and height (<a href="#fig-lineof-best-fit">Figure&nbsp;1</a>). If there is a linear relationship between the two variables, we can use linear regression to model this relationship. However, for the practical explanation in this tutorial we will use a more interesting and research based dataset than this simple example of linear relationship between age and height.</p>

<h1>Dataset</h1>
<p>In this tutorial we will use <a href="&quot;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/palmerpenguins/index.html&quot;">“palmerpenguins: Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) Penguin Data”</a> by <a href="https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins">Allison Horst</a>. The simplified version of Palmerpenguins dataset contains size measurements for 344 adult foraging Adélie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins observed on islands in the Palmer Archipelago near Palmer Station, Antarctica. The original data were collected and made available by Dr.&nbsp;Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program.</p>

<section id="culmen-measurements" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="culmen-measurements">Culmen measurements</h2>
<p>What are culmen length &amp; depth? The culmen is “the upper ridge of a bird’s beak” (definition from Oxford Languages). In the simplified <code>penguins</code> subset, culmen length and depth have been updated to variables named <code>bill_length_mm</code> and <code>bill_depth_mm</code>.</p>
<p>For this penguin data, the bill/culmen length and depth are measured as shown below.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-filtering-and-transformation">Data filtering and transformation</h2>
<p>Before we can build our model(s) let’s filter the data for non useful features or missing values. The unfiltered dataset contains 344 rows and 7 columns. We will first drop <code>year</code> column and then remove any row with no value for any features. Below is the code to load the dataset and filter.</p>

<h1>Building the linear regression model for inferential modeling</h1>
<p>Utilizing the dataset prepared above, we will first build two models with slightly different feature sets for inferential modeling, i.e., to understand how the features influence the model prediction and what features are more informative than the others.</p>
<section id="first-model" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="first-model">First model</h2>
<p><strong>In the first model</strong>, we will regress body mass in grams, i.e., the body_mass_g column in the table below on three numeric features <code>bill_length_mm</code>, <code>bill_depth_mm</code>, <code>flipper_length_mm</code>, and one categorical feature <code>sex</code> (female and male).</p>
<p>We will use the <code>lm</code> function from the base R to fit the linear regression model and the <code>summary()</code> function to summarize the output of the model fitting. The summary provides several useful statistics that can be used to interpret the model.</p>
<p>To execute the <code>lm()</code> function in R, we must provide a formula describing the model to fit and the input data. The formula for our model can be written as</p>

<p>Let’s go through the summary of our fitted linear regression model which typically includes the following statistics (from top to bottom):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Call</strong>: Call section shows the parameters that were passed to the <code>lm()</code> function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Residuals</strong>: Residuals represent the differences between the actual and predicted values of the dependent variable (<code>body_mass_g</code>). The summary shows statistics such as minimum, first quartile (1Q), median, third quartile (3Q), and maximum values of the residuals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Coefficients</strong>: The coefficients table presents the estimated coefficients for each predictor variable. The <code>Estimate</code> column shows the estimated effect of each variable on the dependent variable. The <code>Std. Error</code> column indicates the standard error of the estimate, which measures the variability of the coefficient. The <code>t value</code> column represents the t-statistic, which assesses the significance of each coefficient. The <code>Pr(&gt;|t|)</code> column provides the p-value, which indicates the probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme as the one calculated if the null hypothesis were true (null hypothesis: the coefficient is not significant).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>(Intercept)</code> coefficient represents the estimated body mass when all the predictor variables are zero.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>bill_length_mm</code>, <code>bill_depth_mm</code>, and <code>flipper_length_mm</code> coefficients indicate the estimated change in body mass associated with a one-unit increase in each respective predictor.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>sexmale</code> coefficient represents the estimated difference in body mass between males and females (since it’s a binary variable). Here <code>female</code> is the reference value, which means that males are <code>541.029 g</code> heavier than females.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The significance of each coefficient can be determined based on the corresponding p-value. In this case, the <code>(Intercept)</code>, <code>bill_depth_mm</code>, <code>flipper_length_mm</code>, and <code>sexmale</code> coefficients are all highly significant (p &lt; 0.001), indicating that they have a significant effect on the body mass. However, the <code>bill_length_mm</code> coefficient is not statistically significant (p = 0.619), suggesting that it may not have a significant effect on body mass.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Residual standard error</strong>: This value represents the standard deviation of the residuals (340.8), providing an estimate of the model’s prediction error. <strong><em>A lower residual standard error indicates a better fit.</em></strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multiple R-squared and Adjusted R-squared</strong>: The multiple R-squared value (0.823) indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the predictor variables. The adjusted R-squared (0.8208) adjusts the R-squared value for the number of predictors in the model, penalizing the addition of irrelevant predictors. <strong><em>A higher R-squared value indicates a better fit.</em></strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>F-statistic and p-value</strong>: The F-statistic tests the overall significance of the model by comparing the fit of the current model with a null model (no predictors). The associated p-value (&lt; 2.2e-16) suggests that the model is highly significant and provides a better fit than the null model. <strong><em>A low p-value indicates that the model is statistically significant.</em></strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, this linear regression model suggests that the numerical features <code>bill_depth_mm</code>, <code>flipper_length_mm</code>, and the categorical feature <code>sex</code> are significant predictors of the body mass of penguins. However, <code>bill_length_mm</code> does not appear to be a significant predictor in this model.</p>

<section id="comparing-the-two-models" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comparing-the-two-models">Comparing the two models</h2>
<p>We can make two important observations by comparing the two models we built above. First, changing features may influence the coefficient/significance of other features. We see that in the first model, <code>bill_length_mm</code> was not significant, but in the second model, it is marginally significant. Second, different sets of features may represent different proportions of variance in the dependent variable that the predictor variables can explain. The second model shows that R-squared values have increased to 0.8752 and 0.8721 from 0.823 and 0.8208. This means that the two additional variables helped capture more variance. Therefore, choosing an appropriate set of features that best describes the complexity of the data is important.</p>

<h1>Building the linear regression model for predictive modeling</h1>
<p>Building a linear regression model for predictive modeling is no different from inferential modeling. However, while evaluating the model performance, we focus on the predictive accuracy of the unseen data (test data) rather than the significance of features in the training data. The set of features may influence the model’s predictive performance; therefore, using the most informative features is important. However, while optimizing a model for the highest predictive performance, our metric is the overall prediction accuracy.</p>
<p>We will again build two models with the same set of features as before. However, we need to split the data into training and test sets randomly. Conventionally the train and test splits are 80% and 20% of the data, respectively.</p>

<p>MSE, RMSE, and MAE give a measure of the prediction error, with lower values indicating better model performance and more accurate predictions. The RMSE is often preferred over MSE because it is in the same unit as the dependent variable, making it easier to interpret in the context of the problem. MAE does not square the prediction errors as the MSE does. Consequently, the MAE does not overly penalize larger errors, making it more robust to outliers in the data.</p>

## How is linear regression models are different from linear mixed-effects models?

Linear regression models and linear mixed-effects models are similar in that they are both used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. However, there are a few key differences between the two types of models:

Linear regression models assume that the errors between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), whereas linear mixed-effects models allow for the errors to be correlated and for the variance of the errors to vary across groups.

Linear regression models are used to model the relationship between variables in a single dataset, whereas linear mixed-effects models are used to model the relationship between variables in multiple datasets that have a hierarchical structure. For example, linear mixed-effects models can be used to model the relationship between variables in a study with multiple subjects, where each subject has multiple observations.

Linear regression models are estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS), whereas linear mixed-effects models are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). This means that the parameters in a linear mixed-effects model are estimated by finding the values that maximize the likelihood of the data given the model, whereas the parameters in a linear regression model are estimated by minimizing the sum of the squared errors between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable.

Overall, linear regression models are suitable for modeling relationships between variables in a single dataset when the errors are i.i.d., whereas linear mixed-effects models are more suitable for modeling relationships between variables in multiple datasets with a hierarchical structure and correlated errors.

How to mitigate and interpret models built with multiple colinear variables.</h2>
<p>Multicollinearity is a situation in which two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other. This can be a problem in linear regression because it can lead to unstable and unreliable estimates of the regression coefficients.</p>
<p>There are a few ways that multicollinearity can affect linear regression:</p>
<p>It can cause the standard errors of the regression coefficients to be inflated, leading to a decrease in the statistical power of the model.</p>
<p>It can make it difficult to interpret the individual contributions of the independent variables to the dependent variable because the coefficients of the correlated variables will be correlated as well.</p>
<p>It can make the model more sensitive to small changes in the data, leading to unstable predictions.</p>
<p>To mitigate the effects of multicollinearity, you can do the following:</p>
<p>Remove one or more of the correlated variables from the model.</p>
<p>Use regularization techniques such as Lasso or Ridge regression, which can help to shrink the coefficients of correlated variables towards zero.</p>
<p>Transform the correlated variables by taking their logarithm, square root, or other non-linear transformation.</p>
<p>Use variable selection techniques such as backward elimination or forward selection to select a subset of uncorrelated variables for the model.</p>
<p>To interpret a model built with multiple collinear variables, you can look at the R-squared value and the p-values of the individual variables to assess their contribution to the model. However, it is important to bear in mind that the estimates of the regression coefficients may be unstable and unreliable due to the presence of multicollinearity.</p>

## Is there any other method that resembles linear regression?

There are several statistical techniques that resemble linear regression, in the sense that they are used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Some examples of these techniques include:

Polynomial regression: This technique is used to model relationships between variables that are non-linear. It involves fitting a polynomial function to the data, which can be used to make predictions about the dependent variable based on the independent variables.

Logistic regression: This technique is used to model binary outcomes, such as whether a patient will recover from a disease or not. It involves fitting a logistic curve to the data, which can be used to estimate the probability of the dependent variable taking on one of the two possible values.

Stepwise regression: This technique is used to select a subset of relevant independent variables for the model by adding or removing variables based on their statistical significance. It can be used to build a linear regression model with a smaller number of variables, which can be helpful in situations where there are many potential independent variables.

Ridge regression: This technique is a variant of linear regression that adds a regularization term to the objective function. The regularization term helps to shrink the coefficients of correlated variables towards zero, which can help to reduce the effects of multicollinearity.

Lasso regression: This technique is another variant of linear regression that adds a regularization term to the objective function. Unlike Ridge regression, which shrinks the coefficients of all variables towards zero, Lasso regression shrinks the coefficients of some variables all the way to zero, effectively eliminating them from the model. This can be helpful in situations where there are many correlated variables and we want to select a subset of the most important variables for the model.
