# Statistics

-   [The ASA Statement on *p*-Values: Context, Process, and Purpose](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108)


::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Excerpt

*Statistical significance is not equivalent to scientific, human, or economic significance. Smaller p-values do not necessarily imply the presence of larger or more important effects, and larger p-values do not imply alack of importance or even lack of effect... No single index should substitute for scientific reasoning.*
