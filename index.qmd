Welcome!

This is a tutorial website with concepts and ready code (R or Python) on various topics related to data science, statistics, and machine learning. I started this website to document the code I saved in GitHub gists. However, after a while, I realized that too many GitHub gists are harder to manage, and also search engines might not index them for others to use. Therefore, a website like this would serve both purposes.

I intend to write posts as complete and explanatory as possible. However, many posts could just be code with a minimal description. If you want to get involved and help improve an article, please leave a comment or open a pull request at <https://github.com/rohitfarmer/dataalltheway>.

I hope you will find this resource helpful.
