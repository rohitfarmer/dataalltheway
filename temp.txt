Welcome to Data All The Way, *"yet another"* tutorial website with concepts, methods, and example code on data science, statistics, and machine learning. All the posts with example code accompany a Kaggle or Google Colab notebook for a live demo. In addition, posts are citable, and some posts are hosted on Zenodo with a permanent DOI and indexed in [Data All The Way community](https://zenodo.org/communities/data-all-the-way/). If you want to become a contributing author, please write to **rohit \[dot\] farmer \[at\] dataalltheway \[dot\] com**. Comments and suggestions are always welcomed. To learn more about my other projects and research, please visit <https://rohitfarmer.com>.

> *I intend to write blog posts that are as complete and explanatory as possible. However, many posts could just be codes with a minimal description initially, eventually evolving into more complete articles. Therefore, most posts here are in a state of continuous development with a history of updates.*
